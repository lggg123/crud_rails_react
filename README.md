Simple airline review app using Ruby on Rails and React. 

To run the app make sure to have rails 6.1.4 installed and Ruby 3.0.1 

Once that is done make sure to create your database using `rails db:create` 

After the database is done being created proceed to run `rails db:migrate` to migrate all the tables to be created to your schema. 

Then run `rails db:seed` to load the database. 

Once that is done run `rails s` to start your server and enjoy the app!
